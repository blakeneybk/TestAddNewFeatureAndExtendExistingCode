# Interview Project Template
This was a fictitious test to showcase my ability to work with existing api code, extend existing functionality, and add new functionality to support some anticipated front end functionality. The actual changes I made for the test can be found in an incomplete pull request from dev => main branch. The goal was not to refactor technical debt. Any technical debt would be noted in standup and worked into the backlog before addressing because hidden work is bad and rabbit holing down major refactors is bad team manners.
